# How Green?

How Green? is an application, created for the Human Computer Interaction (H) Coursework, aiming to provide awareness about green shopping.

## Getting Started

Assuming you have the repository cloned, and Node installed, run:

### Frontend

```sh
$ yarn              # or npm install
$ yarn run serve    # or npm run serve
```
If you are having trouble running npm install run `npm install --global yarn` and make sure you have npm added to PATH in your enviroment variables (C:\...\AppData\Roaming\npm). After you have done this run the command 'yarn' and yarn should start to install, then continue on with the installation process. 

### Backend

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt   # recommended to use environment
$ python run.py
```

### Extension

```sh
$ cd extension
$ yarn              # or npm install
$ yarn run start    # or npm run start
```

The extension will be in `dist/` with `manifest.json` that can be added to your browser.
